We plan on modeling our sentances by first having sigs that model parts of speech, like nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs.
The predicates will model grammatical rules like subject-verb-object agreement.

Sigs:
- sentence (list of words, periods, commas, etc.)
- words (capitalized or not capitalized, etc.)

- Types of words:
-   nouns
-   verbs
-   adjectives
-   etc.
